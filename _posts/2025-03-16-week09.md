title: Week 9 - Almost Break!
---

## Progress on *Preswald*
This week in our group work we encountered our first major setback: we have some rival contributors competing for our issues. When we were scoping out *Preswald*, we saw that there's not robust system for assigning issues, but that didn't seem to us like it would be a problem, since the project isn't terribly active. This week though, someone jumped us by submitting a PR on an issue we were working on, and another has been commenting on an issue we're working on, documenting their progress on completing it. <!--more--> There's not much we can do about it at this point, since the PR has already been made, but in the future we plan to work a little faster on our issues, knowing that they're at risk of being fixed while we're working on them. Also, we're considering working more collaboratively on issues moving forward, rather than each working on one individually, so we can accomplish an issue faster and reduce the risk of it getting stolen. For now, though, over break we plan to finish the last issue we have left, and then select a new batch to get started on once we're all back in the city.
