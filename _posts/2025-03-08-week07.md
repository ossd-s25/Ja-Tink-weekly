title: Week 7 - Group Work!

## Our Project: Preswald
Our project is [Preswald](https://github.com/StructuredLabs/preswald), a tool to create interactive data visualization dashboards. One of our group members, Arnav, discovered the project (I'm not sure how/where- I should ask him about that), and we all liked it right away. One thing about the project that spoke to all of us was how new it is— the project began in December. Development on the project is active, and new things are being added often. We all like the idea of making ciritcal, formative changes to a developing project.

## Progress So Far
We've all been able to install the development environment, and we've already found a few code issues and documentation issues that we've been able to fix. So far we've made three issue reports and corresponding pull requests solving them! We're pretty happy with the progress we've made so far, and we're looking forward to better understanding the project and making even more substantial contributions.

## Roadblocks
Despite our successes, we do have one major roadblock: we haven't made any contact with the project community. As far as we can tell, virtually all the contributors work for the company (Structured Labs) that develops Preswald, and the seem to be working closely with each other. They have posted a link to their Slack channel in multiple places— but access to it is restricted. Everything in their CONTRIBUTING file makes it seem like they are friendly and open to contributions, but I think we will need to put in some leg work to get their attention. Some of the core contributors have their emails on their LinkedIns and encourage people to reach out to them, so we're planning on sending an email at the start of next week explaining our interest in the project. We focused on making some contributions to the project this week to show our commitment so our email lands with a little more "oomph".
